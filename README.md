## ADM-HW1
This repository contains the required files for ADM Homework 1.<br /> 
The files include answers to both Problem 1 and Problem 2 in order to avoid creating multiple documents. Furthermore, the answers to Problem 2 are located at the end of the lists.

In scripts.py, all exercises and their solutions are organized as follows:

Name of Exercise 1  
Solution for Exercise 1  
...  
Name of Exercise 97  
Solution for Exercise 97

Exercises are not presented in the same order as in the homework description, but they follow the same order across both required files.
